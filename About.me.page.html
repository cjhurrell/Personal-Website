        <H1>About Me</H1>


        <p>Hi, I'm Chris! I'm a aspiaring software engineer with a passion for technology and innovation. I love puzzels, and trying to break "no's" into possibilites.</p>
        <p>What do i do when im not getting paid? currently my time is spent learning this and building on my knowledge around the endless abyss that is the technology world.</p>
        <p>When I'm not behind the screen my family keeps me pretty busy, im blessed to have a wife and three children all who love long walks amoungst the great outdoors.</p>
