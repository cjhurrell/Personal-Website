        <p id="page-intro">So, for a whole year ive been driving myself to learn coding! and im proud to after doing this and that have managed to get a first downloadable, auto updateable, desktop app. If your here reading this im very grateful to have your time, and attention, and i hope you find this as exciting as I do!</p>

        <img src="Pictures/BJ day 1.jpeg" alt="picture map of work" class="project-image"><p>This is the image i posted for my day one of achievemnts on LinkedIn. I had already started working on this project at a previous date before i dived into my SQL learning rabbit hole, so had the initial design and buttons set up, but that was all, the game just had a cover and nothing under the hood. Meaning "day 1" was all about setting up a deck maker, ensuring i knew the rules properly so had a clear sight of what i needed to get the game to do, for instance i needed to know the deck needs to be shuffled, so how do i make Javascript suffle an array randomly? or, how do I ensure the game checks my hand value? simple stuff but, I felt without a vision of i need this and that i was gonna stumble and get carried away later down the line.</p>

        <img src="Pictures/BJ day 2.jpeg" alt="picture map of work" class="project-image"><p>Day 2 became more tough, more enticing. The psuedo code was done, my knucles were cracked, time to punch some keys untill i get stuck! This was when i actualy managed to get the deck shuffling functional, how i managed to get the game to deal one card at a time, to properly add in the 'hit' function to draw additional cards or (as i had started) to stick and leave your chances to luck! This day re-introduced me to the 'getElementById' and really helped my understanding of it, having used it previously but only breifly, i really appreciated the need to implement it here and solidify my learning into it.</p>

        <img src="Pictures/BJ day 3.jpeg" alt="picture map of work" class="project-image"><p>This. Felt. Amazing! Day three was honestly such a hype! i felt like a massive milestone was met, and an achievement was worth celebrating. The game was done! It worked, game would generate a 52 playing card deck, would self shuffle the deck, and deal, dealer, player, dealer, player. you can hit to draw, and stick to run dealer logic! it would check for bust, display round feedback to tell you if youve bust or won or lost! you could even re-set after a round was over (or during if your a sore looser) the game fuctioned! you just couldnt see it client side yet!</p>
        
        <img src="Pictures/BJ day 4.jpeg" alt="picture map of work" class="project-image"><p>And what should befall a man after such feats? well.. a fall of course, not that it was tragic but, all the same, my biggest hurddle yet, i found it ever so difficult working out how to make the game actually display the card, the correct cards that are being dealt, trying to hide the dealers second card as to not give the game away and ensuring these hands are added too on the hit and stick functions, or the hidden card is revealed before one should be told if hes lost or not! my brain was in a real scramble and by the end of the night when it was done rather that smiling i think i almost slept instantly where i sat!</p>

        <img src="Pictures/BJ day 5.jpeg" alt="picture map of work" class="project-image"><p>fine tuneing ready for 'production' i guess, a simple polish the game needed that, if i wasnt so drained on day for could have saved me a days work, however it felt like after a little reflection and self admiration on my own work, time to focuse on the UX and fix the little annoyances i had, the screen had a little scroll to it which i didnt like, i needed to be fixed to a simple tweak there. however, the cards came flying out like... well they were being delt by a computer i guess, lightning quick, i pondered through some learning as what methods are better or worse for it and set up earlier functions and made it flow a little smoother, got the game feeling (mildly) more professional and, enjoyable to play.</p>

        <video src="Pictures/BJ day 6.mp4" width="50%" height="50%" alt="picture map of work" class="project-video" controls="Play"></video><p>Now before this i hadnt even heard of electron before, nor had i (obviously) built an app before. Package.json... whats that? main.js? what is going on? I was way over my head but i powered through trying again and again until finally 'npm start' worked and the app would play locally! i had tossed and turned and i settled at this point, making it downloadable was surely right around the corner and also, definetly another days work!</p>

        <video src="Pictures/Dummy.mp4" width="50%" height="50%" alt="picture map of work" class="project-video" controls="Play"></video><p>And thats a wrap! it may not have taken me 7 consecutive days, however im very happy that its done, and more so that 7 days of work i went from an idea and an asthetic to an actual functioning app that i can display on my website, and allow people to install, auto updating ready for me to re-package and make an android app that can be added onto the google playstore. I really appreciate you taking the time to read through this journey, thank you so much!</p>
