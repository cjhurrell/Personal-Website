    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Chris! I'm a aspiaring software engineer with a passion for technology and innovation. I love puzzels, and trying to break "no's" into possibilites.</p>
    <p>What do i do when im not getting paid? currently my time is spent learning this and building on my knowledge around the endless abyss that is the technology world.</p>
    <p>When I'm not behind the screen my family keeps me pretty busy, im blessed to have a wife and three children all who love long walks amoungst the great outdoors.</p>

    <h2>What do i want from coding?</h2>
    <p>what im looking for is to break into the tech space and explore its capabilities, but i feel its best to explain how i got where i am in order to show you where im headed.</p>
    <p>My adventure all began sometime early 2024, i had re-taken over control of my resturants GP responsibilities and at some point down the line i began to find a few repeted tasks tedius and tiresome, demotivating me from the real work at hand. so this is where the fun began and i started to look into the full capabilities of the excel program.</p>
    <p>My discoveries lead me to learn that excel has a very useful skill, it can scrape websites! amazing! no more tiresome copy and pasting weekly-monthly numbers in order to keep my documents up to date and relevent, i can automate this process and save myself hair pulling moments freeing myself up to focus on the important things that require a keen eye, the analysing and understanding on my usual day to day work.</p>
    <p>However, it wasnt as easy as i had initially thought, i spent weeks trying and tweaking opertunities and methods to get excel do do what i was asking, constantly scouring the web on why i was getting these errors and this constant bombardment of blocks and failed access. You see, the company i work for has (respectfully) all their data hidden in websites that require a seriese of authentication, and limited access to authorised personel</p>
    <p>Now this back and fourth of idea and failure, to new idea to another pitfall threw me through a plethora of failed methods, i obviously tried plain scraping through external methods and excels built-in style with zero results. I attempted to dabble in macros.... however given my limeted knowledge on tech at the time i decided to back out of that pretty quick upon realasing the potential harm it could cause.</p>
    <p>Then i finaly ended up in API teritory, now i'll warn you now, this is not a victory story, so dont be getting your hopes up in reading about a genius masterclass of an untrained inside hacker, this is a story of hope, failure, and perserverance. when i learned that API keys were a possibility i messaged my helpful central support team in a call for arms! And was quite quickly turned away.</p>
    <p>Probably should have listened, in fairness to this day my pursuit hasnt got me what i wanted and im still copying and pasting the same data on the regular, but if youve been paying attention i ignore "no's" and instead see a different path of try something else. So i did, i learned to access the source code of a web page! at the time i thought i'm so close here i must be moments from cracking the case! i found an API key, my impossible holy grail is now within my grasp!</p>
    <p>Denied! overwhelmed with the emotions of the highs and lows i had experienced on this idea for weeks at this point, i once more reached out to my central team in hopes of aid, and this time.. was still told no but directed to a diffrent platform of individuals within the compay who are all in the tech department on slack. now this, was, eye, opening!</p>
    <p>I begin by posting in the channel what i was attempting to do, what ive tried, and what went wrong. and i recived the politest "you will never achive what your trying to do" in my life! This interaction brought me into contact with two individuals, Ed, and Liam. no Liam has helped me a lot and been someone ive truly admired, weve had some good chats and it's kept me intrigued and yet confident that the future of tech in this company lies in good hands.</p>
    <p>Now my breif interaction with Ed he discribed my best route as "learning a little python" and utomating a few csv emails and thats probably as close as i would get. now looking into it, learning a whole programming language just for this one task seemed daunting and given my normal work load and my real life all around me all this got put aside and essentially forgotten about for sometime, its like i had given up.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to November and ive just bought a house and preparing for christmas! realising this important step is now settled and a lot of the day-to-day stress levels have dropped down a few pegs, i decided to venture into the coding world, i looked back and took Ed's advice, i was going to learn python!</p>
    <p>Roll on January 2025 and ive commited, got myself a laptop and began my python journey. im watching videos, im learning on mimo, solo leard, reading automating to boring stuff and watching countless youtube videos. This journey consumes me! And what i learn most is how little i know at all, excited to push the boundaries and to begin tackling my 2024 problems i start building a program for work.</p>
    <p>Now im sucsessful in this, its not quite what i had planned i decided to tackle small steps first. so essentially what this program does is opens all the paperwork we print out on a monday morning, changes the date to all of them including multiple sheets on more complex paperwork and prints them all out before anyone arrives at the building.</p>
    <p>Initially this was a ground breaking development for me and I was overjoyed whith what i had achived, and this was the turning point, i put a post on linked-in to explain my passion for learning this beautiful tech world, and loest behold its ackoledged by a familiar face, Liam, who introduces me to a fellow employee, Julian.</p>
    <p>Now Julian has been an exceptional help and guide for me through all this, super helpful and encouraging and has helped bring me onto the path our company is working on most with web development. So i begin to learn some HTML, CSS, and a touch JavaScript. fast forward to May 2025 and i begin making my personal website that your reading right now!</p>
